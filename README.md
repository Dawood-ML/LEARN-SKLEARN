# Scikit-Learn: From Theory to Production

This repository documents my journey to master scikit-learn and practical machine learning. It's not just about a final project; it's about the entire learning process, from the ground up.

## The Goal

Simple: To go from knowing the math behind machine learning to being able to build, tune, and deploy real-world ML models that solve actual problems. This means moving beyond notebooks and writing clean, effective, and maintainable ML code.

## What's Inside?

This repo is structured as a series of hands-on projects, each tackling a different ML challenge. You'll find:

*   **Bare Fundamentals:** Quick, focused exercises to build muscle memory with the scikit-learn API.
*   **Real-World Projects:** Deep dives into complex datasets, covering everything from fraud detection and customer segmentation to time-series forecasting.
*   **Production-Ready Code:** A focus on writing modular code, building robust pipelines, and properly documenting everything so it could be handed off to a team.

Each project folder is self-contained and includes:
- A clear `README.md` explaining the problem, the approach, and the results.
- `notebooks/` for exploration and analysis.
- `src/` for reusable Python code (data processing, model training, etc.).
- `requirements.txt` to make it easy to run.

## My Learning Philosophy

1.  **Learn by Doing:** Theory is great, but you don't truly understand something until you build it.
2.  **Start with a Problem:** Every project starts with a real-world question, not a specific algorithm. The problem dictates the tools.
3.  **Iterate and Improve:** Get a simple baseline working first, then systematically improve it with better features, tuning, and more advanced models.
4.  **Document Everything:** If I can't explain what I did and why, I don't really understand it.

This is a living project. It will be messy at times, but it will be a real and honest reflection of the path to ML mastery.

Feel free to follow along, open an issue, or suggest an improvement.
