    "### **Chunk 7: Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Concept Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Hyperparameters vs. Parameters**: Model **parameters** are learned from the data during `.fit()` (e.g., the coefficients in `LinearRegression`). Model **hyperparameters** are settings you choose *before* training (e.g., the number of trees in a `RandomForest`).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Problem with `train_test_split` for Tuning**: How do you pick the best hyperparameter? You could try several values, train each on `X_train`, and see which performs best on `X_test`. **This is a trap!** By using `X_test` to choose your hyperparameter, you have implicitly leaked information from the test set into your model selection process. Your final performance estimate will be overly optimistic. The test set must be kept in a vault, untouched until the very end.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Cross-Validation (CV)**: The solution is to create a *validation set* out of the training set. The most robust way to do this is **K-Fold Cross-Validation**.\n",
    "    1.  You split the *training data* into K equal-sized \"folds\" (e.g., K=5).\n",
    "    2.  You train your model on K-1 folds and evaluate it on the held-out fold.\n",
    "    3.  You repeat this K times, with each fold getting its turn as the validation set.\n",
    "    4.  The final performance is the average of the K scores. This gives a much more stable and reliable estimate of your model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "    5.  **`StratifiedKFold`** is essential for classification. It ensures that the class distribution in each fold is the same as in the overall training set, which is critical for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Hyperparameter Tuning Tools**:\n",
    "    1.  **`GridSearchCV`**: The brute-force method. You define a \"grid\" of hyperparameters you want to test (e.g., `n_estimators: [100, 200, 300]`, `max_depth: [5, 10, 15]`). It then uses cross-validation to exhaustively train and evaluate a model for *every single combination* of these parameters. It's thorough but can be very slow.\n",
    "    2.  **`RandomizedSearchCV`**: A smarter, faster alternative. Instead of trying every combination, it samples a fixed number of random combinations from the grid. This is often more efficient because not all hyperparameters are equally important.\n",
    "    3.  **Optuna (The Modern Standard)**: This is where we level up. Optuna is an advanced hyperparameter optimization framework that uses intelligent search strategies (like Bayesian optimization) to find the best parameters. Instead of searching blindly, it learns from past trials. If it sees that high values of a certain parameter are performing poorly, it will stop exploring that region and focus on more promising areas. This makes it vastly more efficient and effective than grid or random search. We will use Optuna as our primary tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Dataset EDA: Credit Approval Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset from the UCI repository concerns credit card applications. Due to confidentiality, all feature names have been anonymized (A1, A2, etc.). It's a great real-world example with mixed data types and a slightly imbalanced target, making it perfect for a tuned pipeline. The goal is to predict whether an application was approved (+) or rejected (-).\n"
